# V86P 8-Bit IDE Controller

This is a variant of the XT-IDE ISA controller by [Glitch Works](http://www.glitchwrks.com/xt-ide) for Victor V86P 8086 laptops and compatibles.

This board is intended to be used with a custom BIOS like the XT-IDE Universal BIOS.

This design is based on [rev 4 of the Glitch Works XT-IDE](https://github.com/glitchwrks/xt_ide/tree/rev_4) using the information obtained by [MattinX](https://knm.org.uk/blog/2017/05/v86p-expansion/).
